# Thermostat

This is an implementation of the Makers Academy Week 5 Thermostat Challenge. In this project I diverged slightly from the path of implementing a simple thermostat where the user clicks a button to increase/decrease the temperature by a degree at a time. Instead, the user selects their desired temperature from a range of values.  

I have used a weather API (openweathermap.org) to display the outside weather conditions and temperature for London.

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can set the temperature to the desired degrees
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20° with the reset button
* The thermostat displays its current energy usage:  
< 18° is low-usage  
< 25° is medium-usage  
\>= 25° is high-usage.
